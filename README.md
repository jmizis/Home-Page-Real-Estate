# Project-2

## Description

This project was a test of our coding skills, along with a test of our teamwork skills.  We were supposed to design an application and build an app using the MVC paradigm, creating our own server-side API, add user authentication, and connect to a database. We Chosse to create a real estate application where you can create a log in to be able to view our listings.

## Challenges

Even thought our group believes that we created an application that meets high standards, that doesn't mean the we didn't have our fair share of challenges throughout the project. We had multiple challenges throughout the process. We each had our own resposibilities but when we were stuck on something we came together as a group to discuss the issues we had. Working together we were able to get throught the challenges and create our application.

### GitHub and Branches

Event though we had issues we did a excellent job on working with github and our branches. We always made sure we worked on our own branch to eliminate any merge conflicts but also made sure we double checked any pull request we did before approving them in to our main branch. 








### Heroku
For this project we had to deploy our application to heroku.

## Conclusion

This project was a great way for us to show off our newly learned skills, along with also allowed us to work as a whole group to complete a task. There were a lot to do in a sort period of time but we each took our own task and completed it step by step. At times we were stuck or had issues but we overcame that as a group to complete the best application.
